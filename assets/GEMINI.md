### Quickstart Guide

<!-- ðŸ”§ BEGIN REPLACE Update this section with your actual project information -->
This document provides a quick-start guide for both humans and AI agents working with this codebase.

#### Structure
Example modular: "Code is organized in feature-based modules with clear separation of concerns"
Example layered: "Three-tier architecture with presentation, business logic, and data access layers"
Example domain-driven: "Domain-driven design with bounded contexts and aggregate roots"

#### Commands
Example npm: npm run build, npm test, npm start, npm run lint
Example make: make build, make test, make deploy, make clean
Example custom: ./scripts/build.sh, ./scripts/test.sh, ./scripts/deploy.sh

#### Coding Style
Example linting: ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier for formatting
Example documentation: JSDoc for public APIs, inline comments for complex logic
Example naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for files
Example patterns: Functional programming preferred, immutable data structures
