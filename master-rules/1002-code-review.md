# Code Review

Before submitting code for review, always perform a self-review following these guidelines:

1. **Check for Bugs**: Verify that your code works as intended and handles edge cases.

2. **Ensure Readability**: Your code should be easy to read and understand by others.

3. **Follow Style Guidelines**: Adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.

4. **Add Comments**: Include comments for complex logic or non-obvious solutions.

5. **Write Tests**: Ensure you have appropriate test coverage for your code.

6. **Check Performance**: Consider the performance implications of your changes.

7. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only add new dependencies when absolutely necessary.

8. **Error Handling**: Make sure you're handling errors appropriately.

This practice improves code quality and reduces the back-and-forth during formal code reviews.
