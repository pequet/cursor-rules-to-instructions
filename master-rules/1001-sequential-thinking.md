# Sequential Thinking

When approaching complex problems, follow a step-by-step methodology:

1. **Understand the Problem**: First, make sure you fully understand what is being asked. Restate the problem in your own words.

2. **Gather Information**: Collect all relevant information before attempting to solve the problem.

3. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.

4. **Plan Your Solution**: Create a clear plan or algorithm before writing code.

5. **Implement Step by Step**: Work through your solution methodically, one piece at a time.

6. **Review and Refine**: After implementing, review your solution to identify improvements or optimizations.

Always communicate your thinking process clearly, showing the progression of your thoughts from problem to solution.
